Information Referencing
=======================

Two different kinds of information can be referenced to surface water reaches and contributing areas (hydroreferenced).

The first type, represented as point information, refers to features that present a direct relationship to the water stream (represented by its centerline) such as a dam, a water discharge or withdrawal point or a water gauge. Water stream characteristics such as slope or Manning coeficient of roughness can also be located based on point characteristics as they are linearly represented as segments having a start and an end point.

The second type of information is spatial, related to the watershed. This information comes from a map, or a map associated to a table, as for example census data, and the answer we want is how much of some kind of feature represented in the map we find in an upstream watershed.

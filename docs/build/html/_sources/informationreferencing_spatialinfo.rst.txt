Spatial Information Referencing
===============================

Spatial information is described in a PostHydro database by three tables: the first, whose generic name is feature_area, presenting the features in an elementary contributing area, has a value for every feature present in an elementary contributing area; the second, named accum_feature_area, has a value for every feature present upstream of an elementary contributing area; the third has as generic name feature_keys, is a multilingual table presenting the feature keys description.

The generic feature_area table is developed by crossing the specific feature map with the contrib_area table. The spatial procedure accumulate_map generates, taking as input the feature_area table, the generic accum_feature_area table. These two generic tables should then be renamed, according to the feature in question, and their names added to a corresponding register in the information_application table, along with their specific feature_keys table name.

Procedures and Functions
------------------------


.. py:function:: accumulate_map_upstream (reachid)

   Add to the accum_feature_area table records with feature upstream accumulated values corresponding to reachid's contributing
   area, by upstream accumulation of feature values in a feature_area table, with values for every feature in an elementary
   contributing area. Returns the accumulated values upstream as a set of feature_value records with feature id and value

   :param reachid: id of the reach whose feature values will be accumulated
   :type reachid: integer
   :return: feat_val
   :rtype: set of feature_value records

---

.. py:function:: index_feature_area ()

   Index table feature_area on contributing area id

---

.. py:function:: accumulate_map ()

   Upstream accumulate in accum_feature_area a crossing of a map with the individual contributing areas, expressed in feature_area table
